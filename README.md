This is a public repository of my teaching materials. As every teacher knows, materials come from all sorts of places so if any of the documents in this repository are not intended for public sharing, please message me. This is also the reason why there are no audio files in this repository. They might be required for a lot of exercises and exams, but they are most definitely copyrighted by the publishers. I create a lot of exercise sheets, tests, and lesson plans myself, but I also have a lot of material from colleagues and seminars. While this is in many ways my personal collection that I use and update, I hope it can also help other teachers along the way.

The repository generally covers the German subjects "Englisch" and "Wahlpflichtkurs Kreativwerkstatt" for now, though I expect to teach other subjects in the future (likely "Arbeit-Wirtschaft-Technik" and "Gesellschaftslehre"). As such, the material will be in German as I teach at a German school (with grades 5 to 10 currently, or "Sekundarstufe 1"). Some additional subjects might pop up from time to time that are very situational.

It's important to stress that I have not used all the documents so some might not be up to snuff. That's what happens when you share and collect a lot of materials from different sources. The rule is: judge for yourself.

I am always happy to get and share new worksheets and tests or full lesson plans so feel free to message me and I will expand this repository.
